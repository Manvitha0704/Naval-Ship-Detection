# üö¢ Naval-Ship-Detection ‚Äì YOLOv5 Visualization Dashboard

An **interactive React dashboard** showcasing YOLOv5 training performance and mock detection results for naval ship detection. Designed for clarity, professionalism, and presentation-ready demos.

---

##  Features

- **Training Metrics** ‚Äì Visualize precision, recall, and mAP curves generated by YOLOv5  
- **Performance Insights** ‚Äì View confusion matrices and label distributions  
- **Mock Detection Interface** ‚Äì Upload images and simulate detection with visual previews  
- **Responsive UI** ‚Äì Clean layout, mobile-friendly, polished for dashboards
